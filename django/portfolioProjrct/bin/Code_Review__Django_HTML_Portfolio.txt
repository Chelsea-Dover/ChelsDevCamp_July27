Hey Chelsea, 

Your code looks solid, all your views, static files, and urls in django work as advertised. Nice work. 

I believe this is just a convention, but you might consider changing the name of your forum template from forumHtml.html to just forum.html. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a camel case HTML filename - maybe you could start a trend! :)

This isn’t a coding issue, but it would be cool if your about page had some info about you. If someone’s going to your page about hiring you, I think the expectation is there will be some biographical info and/or some info about your technical capabilities. 

Not a django issue, but I can’t get a post to go through on your forum - it was definitely working before. Could very well be something on my end. I’d recommend testing it before going live.   

Also now that you have your static files working, you could delete the commented-out code in your jqindex.html template. 

Other than that, this looks good to check in. I’d love to see the version you were working with on Friday with the animal in the header!
